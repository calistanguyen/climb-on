## Climb On
Climb On is a climbing journal web application to keep track of a climber's progress. They can record their indoor climbing sessions and log each route they climbed. For each route, they can specify what kind of route it is, the difficulty, what they noted about the route, and pictures of the route. The goal of this project is for climbers to be able to remember past climbs they have sent and keep personal records.
