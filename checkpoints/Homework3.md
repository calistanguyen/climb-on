## What I planned on doing for this HW deadline: 
From the last deadline, I planned on creating prototypes of my application so that I have a direction on how I want to design
my application and constructing my database and filling it up with dummy data that I am able to use in my application.

## What I accomplished: 
Over the last few weeks, my goals have changed a little bit. I had to review ReactJs and functional components and was struggling with drawing out on Figma how I want my application to look. I was able to accomplish some front end work by implementing a navigation bar component and figuring out the functionality of the navigation bar by utilizing React UseState hooks. Additionally, over this last week as I was looking into how to integrate Postgres with React, I found out about Postgraphile and GraphQL to manage my database. Even my goals from the last checkpoint mentioned working on my back end, I am glad that I was able to work more on the front end piece –– If I hadn't, I probably would have been stuck trying to figure out my back end work without a front end to display the data. 

## My goals for the next deadline: 
For this next deadline, my goal is to implement a login system. Before I build my database, I think it would be better to first understand how I can build a log in system in my application and understand how different users are indentified in my application. Once I implement a log in and understand how the app recognizes each user, I then want to build my data base and see if I can integrate the data into my application into the cards. I also want to accomplish being able to add to my database through my application as well. So overall, my goals is to understand the technologies I need to integrate PostgresSQL with ReactJS by researching GraphQL and Postgraphile.
